\title{Diagnostic plots for a fit to the Generalized Pareto distribution}
\usage{
gpd.diag(z, conf = 0.95, method = c("delta", "profile"))
}
\arguments{
\item{z}{A class object returned from `gpdFit'.}

\item{conf}{Confidence level used in the return level plot.}

\item{method}{The method to compute the return level confidence interval - either delta method (default) or
profile likelihood. Choosing profile likelihood may be quite slow.}
}
\value{
For stationary models, provides return level, density, probability, and quantile plots for the GPD exceedances. The
overlaid density is the `true' density for the estimated parameters. For nonstationary models, provides
residual probability and quantile plots. In addition, nonstationary models provide plots of the residuals vs.
the parameter covariates.
}
\description{
Allows calling of a 2x2 diagnostic plot, different plots available for
stationary vs non-stationary models.
The extension from EVA allows for direct calling to gpd.diag and plots
produced. Additionally, it exposes the individual plots for custom sizing
(especially via .rmd or .rnw)

\details{
See the reference for details on how return levels are calculated.
