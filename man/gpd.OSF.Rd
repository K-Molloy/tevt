\description{
An Implementation of the procedure proposed in Drees & Kaufmann (1998) for selecting the optimal sample fraction in tail index estimation.
}
\details{
The procedure proposed in Drees & Kaufmann (1998) is based on bias reduction. A stopping criterion with respect to \code{k} is implemented to find the optimal tail fraction, i.e. \code{k/n} with \code{k} the optimal number of upper order statistics. This number, denoted \code{k0} here, is equivalent to the number of extreme values or, if you wish, the number of exceedances in the context of a POT-model like the generalized Pareto distribution. \code{k0} can then be associated with the unknown threshold \code{u} of the GPD by choosing \code{u} as the \code{n-k0}th upper order statistic. If the above mentioned stopping criterion exceedes a certain value \code{r}, the bias of the assumed extreme model has become prominent and therefore \code{k} should not be chosen higher. For more information see references.
